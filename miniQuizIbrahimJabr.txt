HTML:

1- What are some of the key new features in HTML5?

Improved support for embedding graphics, audio, and video content via the new <canvas>, <audio>, and <video> tags.

Extensions to the JavaScript API such as geolocation and drag-and-drop as well for storage and caching.

Introduction of “web workers”.

Several new semantic tags were also added to complement the structural logic of modern web applications. These include the <main>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, and <aside> tags.

New form controls, such as <calendar>, <date>, <time>, <email>, <url>, and <search>.


2- Can a web page contain multiple <header> elements? What about <footer> elements?

Yes to both. In fact, both the <header> and <footer> tags are designed to serve their respective purposes in relation to whatever their parent “section” may be. So not only can the page <body> contain a header and a footer,
but so can every <article> and <section> element. In fact, a <header> should be present for all of these, although a <footer> is not always necessary.


CSS:

1- Explain the usage of "table-layout" property?

The table-layout property defines the algorithm used to lay out table cells, rows, and columns.


2-How does CSS actually work (under the hood of browser)?

When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:

The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
The browser displays the contents of the DOM.


MVC:

1- What is the recommended approach for ASP.NET MVC to globally intercept exceptions? What other functionality can be implemented with the approach?

To intercept exceptions globally, the filter should be registered in Startup.ConfigureServices() as shown below:

services.AddMvc(options => { options.Filters.Add(new ApiExceptionFilter()); });
Authorization, custom action filters (sync and async), and action result transformation can be done with the same approach.
